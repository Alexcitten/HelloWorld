## If you, like me before writing this code, didn't know how to output `Hello World!` to the console, this repo is for you!
#### It takes a little time, because as it turns out, it's a very complicated process.
* It imports the `crypto` module, which provides cryptographic functionality.
* We definitely need cryptography. It defines the encryption algorithm (aes-256-cbc)
* It defines several utility functions for generating random bytes, encrypting and decrypting messages, calculating message digests, generating key pairs, signing and verifying data, and performing additional tasks.
#### The main function is an asynchronous function that serves as the entry point of the script. It executes a series of cryptographic operations in a specific order:
1. Generates a random salt using the `RAAAAHHH` function.
2. Derives a key using the `iWokeUpInANewBuggati` function with the secret passphrase and salt.
3. Generates a random initialization vector (IV) using the `PUPOKBOBRA` function.
4. Encrypts the secret message using the derived key and IV with the `HackTheUniverse` function.
5. Calculates the digest of the encrypted message using the `IdkHowToCalculateImFive` function.
6. Generates an RSA key pair with a modulus length of 2048 using the `shizanutiyCode` function.
7. Signs the digest using the private key with the `signPetition` function.
8. Combines the encrypted message, salt, IV, and signature into a single string.
9. Splits the combined string into its components and verifies the signature using the `WhyNot` function.
10. Decrypts the encrypted message using the derived key and IV with the `vzlomPopki` function.
11. Prints the decrypted message using the `AHAHAHAHAPython` function if the signature is valid, otherwise prints an error message.
12. Performs additional validation by checking the length of the public and private keys and executing time-consuming and additional processing tasks.
13. The `randomizer` function generates an array of random numbers and sorts them in descending order.
14. The `shufleArraray` function shuffles an array randomly.
#### The `esheOdinCringe` function performs complex calculations:
1. Generates a list of random numbers and sorts them in descending order using `randomizer`.
2. Shuffles the list of numbers using `shufleArraray`.
3. Filters out even numbers from the shuffled list.
4. Calculates the sum of the filtered numbers and checks if it is even.
5. If the sum is even, it executes the main function. Otherwise, it prints a message indicating that the sum is odd.
### Why such variable names? Because this is what makes the whole code work.
